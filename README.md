# Project Summary:

The Unified Medical File Project in Hospitals and Health Centers in Yemen (A Unified Medical File in Hospitals and Health Centers in Yemen) is a system that connects medical records across all public and private hospitals and clinics via a web-based platform. The electronic medical record (EMR) is a digital record of a patient's health data generated from multiple visits to healthcare centers, hospitals, and includes medical history, laboratory data, and radiology reports. It allows doctors to review a patient’s medical record, make informed decisions, and update the patient’s record based on previous complications. The system also facilitates obtaining a unified medical record number, enabling both the patient and the doctor to access the medical file from anywhere via the internet.

The website will be user-friendly, requiring no advanced computer skills to use. We utilized modern programming languages and technologies such as ASP.NET, C#.NET, and Android for building and developing the website, which are known for high security and flexibility. The database is created using SQLServer, developed by Microsoft, one of the leading companies in the software industry, known for handling large datasets efficiently.
